#### Warm Up Exercises

To run each sketch, go to index.html and change 
"sketch.js" on line 11 to the one you want to run.

Example:
  
  `<script src="sketch.js" type="text/javascript"></script>`

change to
  
  `<script src="00_mouseX-mouseY.js" type="text/javascript"></script>`


In your Terminal, go to the folder where the files are and run

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

now you can go to your browser

`http://localhost:8000`

and see the sketch running!
